                        <p>Growing up in Belgium, <a class="contant--action"
                                href="https://www.stromae.com/en/"><span>Stromae</span></a> was a big rap fan. “Hip-hop
                            was like school when I was between the ages of 16 and 21,” he
                            said earlier this month. “People like G. Dep, Black Rob and Notorious B.I.G. were my
                            models.”</p>
                        <p class="red-ligne">But it was the homegrown electro combo Technotronic — yes, they were
                            Belgian — that suggested
                            he might be able to get
                            somewhere as a musician. “For me, ‘Pump Up the Jam’ is a classic,” Stromae said, before
                            accurately reeling off the 1989
                            song’s Billboard position: No. 2 on the Hot 100 chart. “There’s something Belgian in me,
                            maybe cynicism or irony or
                            surrealism,” he added. “We’re always a little average — we try to do our best but …”</p>
                        <p class="highlight">Stromae, speaking via video chat from a comfortable couch in his Brussels
                            studio, trailed
                            off, chuckling. Context
                            provided the punchline: Over the past decade, the 36-year-old songwriter, performer and
                            designer, whose gangly
                            silhouette and precise elegance evoke a friendly Buster Keaton, has become a global star
                            with music that blends those
                            early influences: the poetic urgency of hip-hop and the dancey allure of electronic music.

                        <p>In 2015, this son of a Belgian-Flemish mother and Rwandan father became the
                            first Francophone
                            performer singing in
                            French to headline Madison Square Garden; that same year Kanye West joined him onstage at
                            Coachella. But as Stromae’s
                            success, lifted by earworms carrying serious messages like “Alors On Danse” and “Papaoutai,”
                            seemed poised to reach
                            another level, he took a break between albums that stretched to nine years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During that time, his reputation only grew. “He’s mixing this Belgian singer-songwriter
                            tradition, rhythms from all over
                            the place, EDM — I don’t know where to start, really,” said Chris Martin of Coldplay, which
                            featured Stromae on its 2019
                            track “Arabesque.” “It’s as if he’s downloaded the entire history of music into his brain
                            and then sings what comes out.
                            Everything he does has something that makes your synapses fire.”
